# Fair Damage
Garry's Mod addon aiming to equate damage output, accuracy, and health of NPCs and players mainly using `sk_*` convars. This means that combines now have a fair chance against citizens. And NPCs in general go down harder, shoot more accurately, and deal more damage (equal to player's damage output).

This addon also provides a settings tab, where you can change default NPC health, accuracy, and weapon damage.

## Limitations

Since this addon mainly uses `sk_*` convars, it's limited by what `sk_*` convars can do. For example it cannot modify damage scaling depending on which area of the body was hit, or modify custom NPCs.
